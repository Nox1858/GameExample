Hello...
So, I've made a game...

Very basics, you write code, pc translates it into commands, how does coding work, code goes in, action comes out, stuff like that

Why spelling is important, examples
Data types: bools, ints, strings, floats
variables
arrays
if(), while()
functions
classes

all the while, explain why VSC is so cool

show code, explain basic workings
show off how cool the game is

go into some detail, maybe
answer questions

conclude how much you can learn by just trying out stuff
also something on github maybe
